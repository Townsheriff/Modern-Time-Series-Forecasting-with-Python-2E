## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
#Does not support missing values, so using imputed ts instead
res = seasonal_decompose(ts, period=7*48, model="additive",
extrapolate_trend="freq")
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
The book is for data scientists, data analysts, machine learning engineers, and Python developers who want to build industry-ready time series models. Since the book explains most concepts from the ground up, basic proficiency in Python is all you need. Prior understanding of machine learning or forecasting will help speed up your learning. 
For experienced machine learning and forecasting practitioners, this book has a lot to offer in terms of advanced techniques and traversing the latest research frontiers in time series forecasting.	



# Setup the environment
Setting up an environment, preferably a separate one, for the book is highly recommended. There are two main ways we suggest to create the environment – _Anaconda/Mamba_ or _Python Virtual Environment_.

The easiest way to set up an environment is by using _Anaconda_, a distribution of Python for scientific computing. You can use _Minicond_a_, a minimal installer for Conda, as well if you do not want the pre-installed packages that come with Anaconda. And you can also use _Mamba_, a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++. It is much faster than conda and is a drop-in replacement for conda. _Mamba_ is the recommended way because it has much less chances of getting stuck at the dreaded **“Resolving dependencies…”** screen in _Anaconda_. If you are using Anaconda version 23.10 or above, then you need not worry about Mamba that much because the fast and efficient package resolver is part of anaconda by default.

## Using Anaconda/Mamba
1.	1.	Install Anaconda/Miniconda/Mamba/MicroMamba: Anaconda can be installed from https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution. Depending on your operating system, choose the corresponding file and follow the instructions. Alternatively, you can install Miniconda from here: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links. For Mamba and MicroMamba you can install from here: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ . In case you are using Mamba, in all the instructions below replace `conda` with `mamba`.
2.	Open conda prompt: To open Anaconda Prompt (or terminal on Linux or macOS):
    1.	Windows: Open the Anaconda Prompt (Start >> Anaconda Prompt)
    2.	macOS: Open Launchpad and then open Terminal. Type `conda activate`
    3.	Linux: Open Terminal. Type `conda activate`
3. Create a new environment: Use the following command to create a new environment of your choice. For instance, to create an environment named `modern_ts_2E` with Python 3.10 (recommended to use 3.10 or above), use the following command:
`conda create -n modern_ts_2E python=3.10`
4. Activate the environment: Use the following command to activate the environment:
`conda activate modern_ts_2E`
6. Install PyTorch from the official website: PyTorch is best installed from the official website. Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and select the appropriate options for your system. you can replace `conda` with `mamba` if you want to use mamba to install.
7.	Navigate to the downloaded code: Use operating system specific commands to navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the code. For instance, in Windows, use `cd`.
7. Install the required libraries: Use the provided `anaconda_env.yml` file to install all the required libraries. Use the following command:
`mamba env update --file anaconda_env.yml`
This will install all the required libraries in the environment. This can take a while.
8.	Checking the installation: We can check if all the libraries required for the book is installed properly by executing a script in the downloaded code folder
`python test_installation.py`. If the GPU is not showing up, install PyTorch again on top of the environment.
9.	Activating the environment and Running Notebooks: Every time you want to run the notebooks, first activate the environment using the command `conda activate modern_ts_2E` and then use Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter notebook`) or Jupyter Lab (`jupyter lab`) according to your preference.

## Using Pip based environment
1.	Install Python: You can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to install Python 3.10 or above.
2. Create a virtual environment: Use the following command to create a virtual environment named `modern_ts_2E`:
`python -m venv modern_ts_2E`
3. Activate the environment: Use the following command to activate the environment:
    1. Windows: `modern_ts_2E\Scripts\activate`
    2. macOS/Linux: `source modern_ts_2E/bin/activate`
4. Install PyTorch: Pytorch is best installed from the official website. Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and select the appropriate options for your system.
5. Navigate to the downloaded code: Use operating system specific commands to navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the code. For instance, in Windows, use `cd`.
6. Install the required libraries: Use the provided `requirements.txt` file to install all the required libraries. Use the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
This will install all the required libraries in the environment. This can take a while.
7. Checking the installation: We can check if all the libraries required for the book is installed properly by executing a script in the downloaded code folder
`python test_installation.py`
8. Activating the environment and Running Notebooks: Every time you want to run the notebooks, first activate the environment using the command `modern_ts_2E\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source modern_ts_2E/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) and then use Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter notebook`) or Jupyter Lab (`jupyter lab`) according to your preference.

# Download the Data
You are going to be using a single dataset throughout the book. The book uses London Smart Meters Dataset from Kaggle for this purpose. Many of the notebooks from early chapters are dependencies for some of the later chapters.  As such, to remove this dependency if you want to run the notebooks out of order, we have included a data.zip file with all of the required datasets. 
To setup, follow these steps:
1. Download the data from AWS: https://packt-modern-time-series-py.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data.zip 
2. Unzip the content
3. Copy over the data folder to the Modern-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Python-2E folder you pull from github. 

That's it!  You are now ready to start running the code.




# Blocks vs RAM

Number of blocks to select from the dataset is dependent on how much RAM you have in your machine. Although, these are not rules, but rough guidelines on how much blocks to choose based on your RAM is given below. If you still face problems, please experiment with lowering the number of blocks to make it work better for you.

* 1 or <1 Block for 4GB RAM
* 1 or 2 Blocks for 8GB RAM
* 3 Blocks for 16GB RAM
* 5 Blocks for 32GB RAM

## DevContainer

Tested on linux, ubuntu 24.04 host.
It takes some time to build the image and prepare the environment.

### What devcontainer does for you:

- download all dependencies, sets up pyenv with 3.10 (required in book)
- download data.zip and softlinks to your workspace data dir
- mounts project directory
- once started attempts to install all dependencies and runs all checks
- mounts ssh and sets up keys for as post job
- installs a bunch of plugins in vscode
- sets up nvidia video card runtime to allow pytorch access it from docker container
- attempts to setup normal bash environment, but does not fully work (run `bash` in new terminal)

### Prepare host for devcontainer first. Requires:

- nvidia driver
- docker
- docker nvidia runtime
- maybe sometihng I have forgotten...
